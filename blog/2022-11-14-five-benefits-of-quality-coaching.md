There are key differences between the commonly adopted traditional methodology of software testing in the [SDLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle), whereby a tester is simply there to verify and validate functionality of a product, and the ‘Quality Coaching’ approach.

What is Quality Coaching?
-------------------------

Quality coaching is a model of working for Quality Analysts and Developers that is rapidly gaining momentum in the industry, being adopted across startups and fortune 500’s alike. The idea differs from the traditional approach as testers become seen more like consultants than members of a particular team. Developers are expected to perform the testing work for features built, with the quality analysts providing input and advice on testing methods and approaches. This new way of working allows developers and quality analysts to bounce ideas off each other and to collaborate on everything from manual testing steps through to unit and integration test designs.

By following this coaching model, quality analysts also benefit. Working closer to the development team provides new opportunities and training opportunities. Here are the top five reasons I would recommend adopting the Quality Coaching model.

1\. Better communication between developers and quality analysts
----------------------------------------------------------------

Almost anyone who has previously worked as a manual software tester can probably attest to the idea that there is often a disconnect, an ‘us vs them’ mentality that exists between developers and quality analysts. Developers are proud of their code, and they certainly do not like having their code rejected by non-development staff despite their code making it through different checks and balances like a code review.

Bringing your quality analysts closer to the developers allows them to build working relationships with each other, and to understand and respect the role that each other plays.

2\. Teaching each other
-----------------------

Unfortunately, the career pathway for quality analysts can often be confusing or end abruptly. Throughout my career, I have never seen a position exist above something like ‘Quality Manager’ that exists in the testing space. We also regularly see the role of quality analyst get used as a stepping stone for graduates looking to get into developer positions, wanting exposure in some part of the development lifecycle first.

A solid benefit of adopting this approach is that by working closely together, quality analysts and developers gain a great opportunity to learn from each other. Developers are exceptionally technical, able to write specific chains of checks and if statements to ensure that certain functions will execute at just the right time. Quality analysts are exceptionally inquisitive, able to identify edge cases or possible scenarios that no one has considered.

It is because of this that the coaching model works so well. Quality analysts gain a deeper technical understanding of their products, and developers gain a deeper understanding of testing processes and the almost scientific method used to identify possible scenarios that their functionality might run into.

3\. Defect prevention over detection
------------------------------------

The methodology of coaching has overlap with the idea of the shift-left approach to testing, where a tester is brought in to consult on the earliest possible stage of development such as refinement to allow for possible defects to be identified and considered earlier and then built out of the product as the cycle goes into development as opposed to being picked up by testers at the very end. There are a number of benefits to this approach, including having far more time to resolve defects during the development cycle as opposed to identifying them potentially days or hours before release.

By involving a quality coach during the development of features, they are able to essentially shift-left into the development stage without shifting all the way to the refinement and breakdown stages of the lifecycle.

4\. Quality analysts supporting multiple teams
----------------------------------------------

One of the issues people see when scaling up development teams is the idea that you will need one tester per squad of developers, or go down the alternate route of having a team of QAs who essentially provide guidance to the entire business. I have worked in both scenarios before, with the former essentially resulting in too many quality analysts and not enough work, and the latter resulting in a lack of communication and consultation between the quality analysts and the developers.

A quality analyst should be capable of supporting multiple squads under the coaching model. Because the quality analyst is no longer simply a ‘tester’ whose day to day job involves testing individual cards, their time can now be better utilised providing advice and guidance on everything from unit tests through to the way the team itself operates. By not being tied down to being a bottleneck for work items, the quality analyst can now support multiple teams. This leads to quality analysts having a deeper understanding of multiple areas of the business whilst also being able to provide solutions from one team to another. “Hey we ran into this in x team and fixed it by doing y” becomes a common benefit that the quality analyst can provide.

5\. Innovation on both sides
----------------------------

Collaboration breeds innovation. Continuous improvement is the driving force behind quality analysts and the work that they do, so why limit that purely to the product? Quality coaching allows for quality analysts to drive improvements in other areas of the team, including group and org levels. I am for example currently working in a quality coaching model, and some of my recent improvements to my team’s way of working include things like Jira Automations to test automation framework upgrades to implementing new ways of identifying defects by including non-technical roles such as business analysts.

Developers stand to offer significant improvements to the quality analysts’ world as well, such as technical improvements to end to end tests. The ability to upskill quality analysts on areas like CI/CD and architecture also allow them to provide their own lens on decisions made, expanding their scope for improvements and building on their technical confidence.

If you haven’t had a chance yet to see the quality coaching model in practice, a good place to look is Spotify, who have invented and championed the [Spotify model for scaling agile teams](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/agile-at-scale/spotify), allowing roles like Quality Analysts to become cross-disciplinary and provide their expertise across multiple areas of a business. This model allows our quality coaching method to thrive.
